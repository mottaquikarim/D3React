# Topics

Let's learn React by doing. In particular, we will build a few simple apps to explore how React and React components work.

## D3 Specific
* Understand D3 fundamentals
* Familiar with creating basic D3 charts and graphs
* Working with either the [D3v4 or D3v5](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) codebase.
       
## React Specific
* New to [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* Exploring how it can be used to structure an application
* Interested in incorporating it into an existing or new D3 project

## Interactive Applications
- One suggested structure for applying D3 to a React application
- Building a simple React application that uses D3 to visualize data


Sadly, we won't have time to cover a comprehensive review of React + D3 approaches or push our React apps to production.
